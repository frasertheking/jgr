# Using CloudSat-CPR retrievals to estimate snow accumulation in the Canadian Arctic

Data and primary scripts that were used in the creation of this article can be found in this repo. This include multiple data extraction and plotting files used in the generation of our paper results. The daily Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) data used in the paper is stored here in this repo as a csv file (DLY02_2006to2017.xlsx) and the gridded SWE and CloudSat data links are included here as well.

## CloudSat

The 2C-SNOW-PROFILE used to extract snowfall rate information is publically available for download [here](http://www.cloudsat.cira.colostate.edu/data-products/level-2c/2c-snow-profile).

### Blended-4 & ASR

The Blended-4 dataset can be downloaded from [this directory](https://frasertheking.com/data/blended4/).

The Arctic System Reanalysis (ASR) **V1** dataset is avaialable on [NCAR](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds631.0/).

The Arctic System Reanalysis (ASR) **V2** dataset is also avaialable on [NCAR](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds631.1/).

## Requirements

The scripts are run using Python 3.7.3 and require libraries as defined by each file. The easiest way to get these to run is to use anaconda to install all listed dependencies at once.

## Authors

Please reach out to **Fraser King** for more information about the scripts and data posted here.
